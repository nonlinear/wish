# Wish - Commons & Anarchist Principles

*Research notes on how to build this well (and what to avoid)*

## 🏴 Core Anarchist Principles

**Augmented Direct Action:**
- No intermediaries, no bureaucracy
- You help or you're helped, and done
- No central authority deciding who "deserves" help
- Matchmakers facilitate, they don't control

**Mutual Aid (not charity):**
- Reciprocity, not hierarchy
- Today I help you knit, next month you help me fix my computer
- No debts, no tabs, no "owing" 
- Solidarity, not saviorism

**Consent-based:**
- Opt-in only (no pressure to participate)
- Clear boundaries (open vs closed sessions)
- Anyone can leave anytime

**Decentralized:**
- Hyperlocal chapters (not centralized platform)
- Each chapter self-organized
- No scaling beyond walk/bike distance

## 📚 Insights from Commons Literature

### From Elinor Ostrom (Governing the Commons)

**Design principles for successful commons:**

1. **Clearly defined boundaries**
   - Who's in, who's out (hyperlocal = walk/bike distance)
   - What's shared (skills, time, help)
   - What's not (no money, no products for sale)

2. **Congruence between rules and local conditions**
   - Monthly recurring = fits people's schedules
   - Same time/place = low friction
   - Signal groups = people already use it

3. **Collective choice arrangements**
   - Matchmakers don't dictate, they facilitate
   - Community sets norms (code of conduct)
   - Anyone can propose sessions

4. **Monitoring**
   - Not surveillance, just accountability
   - Did people show up? Was it helpful?
   - Feedback loop (what worked, what didn't)

5. **Graduated sanctions**
   - First no-show = reminder
   - Repeated no-shows = gentle conversation
   - Bad actors = removed (but not punitively)

6. **Conflict resolution mechanisms**
   - Clear process for reporting issues
   - Mediation before exclusion
   - Transparent, not secretive

7. **Minimal recognition of rights to organize**
   - No permits needed (just meet at library/park)
   - No legal entity required
   - Keep it informal, adaptable

8. **Nested enterprises** (for larger systems)
   - Start with one chapter (10-50 people)
   - If grows, split into two chapters (not one big one)
   - Chapters can share learnings, not resources

### From Doughnut Economics (Kate Raworth)

**Social norms vs market norms:**
- **Warning:** Introducing money erodes intrinsic motivation
- Payment for help = becomes transactional (not mutual aid)
- Even "time banking" (track hours) can corrupt the vibe
- Keep it gift economy: "I helped you, the end"

**The core economy (unpaid care work):**
- Recognize skill-sharing IS care work
- Time, knowledge, empathy, teaching, reciprocity
- This is what sustains community (not GDP)
- Don't try to monetize or measure it

**Risk of crowding out social norms:**
- Example: Parents fined for late daycare pickup → guilt disappeared
- If you track "hours helped" → becomes a market
- Keep it informal, unmeasured, trust-based

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do (Anti-Patterns)

### ❌ Don't Build a Platform
- No apps, no logins, no user profiles
- Signal groups = enough
- Spreadsheet for matchmakers = enough
- More tech = more surveillance, more fragility

### ❌ Don't Gamify or Track
- No points, no badges, no leaderboards
- No "hours contributed" counters
- No "reputation scores"
- These introduce market norms (competition, debt)

### ❌ Don't Scale Prematurely
- One chapter, one neighborhood first
- If it works, others can copy (not franchise)
- Resist urge to make it "national" or "global"
- Hyperlocal = resilient, scalable = fragile

### ❌ Don't Require Reciprocity
- Don't track "you helped X, so X must help you back"
- Circular reciprocity (A helps B, B helps C, C helps A)
- Some people can only receive right now (that's OK)
- Some people can only give right now (that's OK too)

### ❌ Don't Professionalize
- Matchmakers = volunteers (not paid staff)
- No 501(c)(3) nonprofit (too much overhead)
- No grants, no funding (creates dependency)
- Keep it scrappy, low-cost, volunteer-run

### ❌ Don't Build Identity Around It
- Not a movement, not a brand
- Just neighbors helping neighbors
- No logos, no merch, no "Wish community"
- It's a tool, not an identity

---

## ✅ What TO Do (Patterns That Work)

### ✅ Keep Barriers Low
- No forms, no applications, no approvals
- Show up = you're in
- Want to help? Great. Need help? Great.
- Matchmakers curate, but don't gatekeep

### ✅ Build Trust Through Repetition
- Monthly recurring = people get to know each other
- Same faces, same place, same time
- Trust builds over time, not instantly

### ✅ Make Consent Explicit
- Open sessions (anyone can join) labeled clearly
- Closed sessions (1-on-1) labeled clearly
- "Help me to help you" checklist = consent negotiation
- No surprises, no pressure

### ✅ Celebrate Informality
- No minutes, no reports, no documentation
- Stories > metrics
- "Remember when we fixed that computer together?"
- Oral tradition, not bureaucracy

### ✅ Resist Institutionalization
- When someone says "we should get funding" → say no
- When someone says "we should make an app" → say no
- When someone says "let's expand to other cities" → say "they can copy us"
- Stay nimble, stay informal, stay weird

### ✅ Center Care, Not Productivity
- It's not about "how many people helped"
- It's about "did people feel cared for?"
- Quality of connection > quantity of sessions
- Slow, deep, intentional

## 🌱 How to Start (Practical Steps)

1. **Find 1 matchmaker** (you, or someone trusted)
2. **Find 10 people** who want to participate
3. **Pick a place** (library, park, community center - free)
4. **Pick a time** (2nd Saturday 10am? whatever works)
5. **Create Signal group** (invite people)
6. **Collect wants/offers** (Google Form? Signal poll?)
7. **Build first agenda** (3-5 sessions, open + closed mix)
8. **Meet, help each other, done**
9. **Repeat next month** (if it worked)

**That's it.** No more complexity needed.
