# Wish ROADMAP

*Hyperlocal skill exchange & mutual aid platform*

---

## 🎯 Vision

**Enable neighbors to help neighbors** through monthly recurring skill exchanges and mutual aid meetups. Privacy-first, hyperlocal, human-curated.

**Core loop:**
1. People volunteer skills they offer + help they need
2. Matchmakers pair people, build monthly agenda
3. Helper & seeker align ("help me to help you" checklist)
4. Monthly meetup happens (same time, same place)
5. Repeat next month

**Anti-goals:**
- ❌ No money/currency/time-banking (just mutual aid)
- ❌ No algorithmic matching (human matchmakers)
- ❌ No surveillance capitalism (Signal, not apps that track)
- ❌ No scaling beyond hyperlocal (walk/bike distance)

## 🚧 Current Status

**Phase:** Concept definition  
**Next step:** Design matchmaker workflow (how do organizers build agendas?)

---

## 📋 Epics / Milestones

### Phase 1: Concept & Research
- [x] Define core concept (mutual aid skill exchange)
- [ ] Research existing models (time banks, skill shares, mutual aid networks)
- [ ] Identify what makes this different (hyperlocal + recurring + privacy-first)
- [ ] Talk to potential matchmakers (what do they need?)
- [ ] Talk to potential participants (what barriers exist?)

### Phase 2: Matchmaker Tooling (MVP)
- [ ] Design matchmaker workflow
  - How do people submit wants/offers?
  - How do matchmakers pair people?
  - How is agenda published?
  - How do helper & seeker align before meetup?
- [ ] Choose tech stack (spreadsheet? Airtable? Custom?)
- [ ] Build MVP (simplest thing that works)
- [ ] Test with 1 matchmaker + 10 participants

### Phase 3: First Meetup
- [ ] Find venue (community center, library, park)
- [ ] Recruit 1 matchmaker
- [ ] Recruit 10-15 participants
- [ ] Build first agenda (3-5 sessions)
- [ ] Run first meetup
- [ ] Gather feedback, iterate

### Phase 4: Sustainability
- [ ] Document matchmaker playbook
- [ ] Recruit 2nd matchmaker (backup/rotation)
- [ ] Establish recurring schedule (2nd Saturday every month?)
- [ ] Build community norms (code of conduct, conflict resolution)
- [ ] Evaluate: Is this working? Should it continue?

## 🔍 Research Questions

**What exists already?**
- Time banks (too currency-like?)
- Skill shares (too one-off?)
- Meetup.com chapters (too corporate, not mutual aid focused)
- Community fridges / tool libraries (physical goods, not skills)
- Mutual aid networks (crisis-focused, not ongoing skill exchange)

**What's unique here?**
- **Recurring:** Monthly, same time/place (low overhead)
- **Hyperlocal:** Walk/bike distance only
- **Privacy-first:** Signal, no central surveillance
- **Human-curated:** Matchmakers, not algorithms
- **Mutual aid frame:** Not transactional, just neighbors helping

**Who are the matchmakers?**
- Community organizers
- People who like facilitating (not just participating)
- Need lightweight tooling (can't be a full-time job)

**What tools do matchmakers need?**
- Collect wants/offers (Google Form? Signal poll?)
- Pair people (spreadsheet? Notion? Custom tool?)
- Publish agenda (shared calendar? PDF? Signal post?)
- Facilitate "help me to help you" alignment (template?)

## 🛠️ Design Decisions

### Communication Platform: Signal
**Why:**
- ✅ Privacy-first (E2E encrypted)
- ✅ Everyone already has it (or can get it)
- ✅ Group chat = natural fit for coordination
- ✅ No corporate tracking

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Not great for scheduling/agenda (need separate tool)
- ❌ Discovery harder (can't browse, need invite link)

### Matchmaker Role: Human-Curated
**Why:**
- ✅ Context matters (know the community, spot good matches)
- ✅ Algorithms optimize for engagement, not mutual aid
- ✅ Builds trust (people know who's organizing)

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Doesn't scale beyond ~50 people per matchmaker
- ❌ Requires community organizers (not everyone wants to do this)

### Meetup Cadence: Monthly Recurring
**Why:**
- ✅ Predictable (low planning overhead)
- ✅ Not too frequent (burnout)
- ✅ Not too rare (momentum)

**Trade-offs:**
- ❌ Some urgent needs can't wait a month
- ❌ Some people can't commit monthly

## 💡 Ideas / Backlog

- **"Help me to help you" template:** Pre-meetup alignment form
- **Session types:** Open (anyone can join) vs Closed (1-on-1)
- **Skill tags:** Standardized categories for easier matching
- **No-show policy:** How to handle flakes without being punitive?
- **Safety:** Code of conduct, conflict resolution, reporting
- **Growth:** When does a chapter split into two (size limit)?
- **Async help:** Not everything needs in-person (some can be Signal/Zoom)
- **Library integration:** Partner with local libraries for venue/promotion

## 🌍 Example Use Cases

**A wants to learn knitting, B offers knitting help:**
- Matchmaker pairs them
- B asks A: "Do you have yarn/needles, or should I bring extras?"
- Session marked "open" → anyone can join
- Monthly meetup: 10-11am, B teaches A (and anyone else) basic stitches

**C needs debt refinancing help, D offers financial literacy:**
- Matchmaker pairs them
- D asks C: "What debts do you have? Bring statements if comfortable"
- Session marked "closed" (privacy)
- Monthly meetup: 11am-12pm, D walks C through refinancing options

**E has broken computer, F offers basic repair:**
- Matchmaker pairs them
- F asks E: "What's broken? Bring the computer"
- Session marked "open" → maybe G also has computer issues
- Monthly meetup: 12-1pm, F diagnoses + fixes with E (and G)
