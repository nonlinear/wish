# Wish

A hyperlocal, privacy-first skill exchange and mutual aid platform.

## Overview

**Wish** connects people who want to learn with people who want to teach, and people who need help with people who can offer it. It's built around **monthly recurring meetups** where neighbors help neighbors—no money, no tracking, just community.

### How It Works

1. **People volunteer** their skills/needs
   - "I want to learn: knitting, debt refinancing, Python"
   - "I can help with: basic computer repair, Spanish tutoring, gardening"

2. **Matchmakers** (community organizers) pair people
   - Match wants with offers
   - Build monthly agenda (same time, same place)
   - Mark sessions as **open** (others can join) or **closed** (1-on-1)

3. **Helper & seeker align** before the meetup
   - "Help me to help you" checklist
   - What do you need prepared? What should I bring?
   - Clear expectations, low friction

4. **People meet, help each other, move on**
   - Monthly recurring (predictable schedule)
   - Hyperlocal (walk/bike distance)
   - Privacy-first (Signal groups, no surveillance)

### Example Agenda

**February Meetup - Saturday 10am @ Community Center**

- **10:00-11:00** - A & B: Knitting basics (open - anyone can join)
- **11:00-12:00** - C & D: Debt refinancing (closed - 1-on-1)
- **12:00-13:00** - E & F: Fix old computer (open)

## Principles

- **Privacy-first:** Signal groups, no central database, minimal data
- **Hyperlocal:** Walk/bike distance, same neighborhood
- **Recurring:** Monthly meetups, same time/place (low planning overhead)
- **Mutual aid:** No money, no hustle, just neighbors helping neighbors
- **Consent-based:** Open vs closed sessions, clear boundaries
- **Matchmaker-curated:** Human organizers, not algorithms

## Open Questions

- **Matchmaker tooling:** What do organizers need to build agendas efficiently?
- **Signal vs other:** Is Signal the right platform, or custom chat needed?
- **Scaling:** How many people per meetup? Per matchmaker?
- **Safety:** How to handle bad actors, harassment, no-shows?
- **Onboarding:** How do new people find/join their local chapter?
- **Incentives:** What motivates matchmakers to organize (not just participate)?

## Tech Stack

- **Communication:** Signal (private groups)
- **Coordination:** [TBD - spreadsheet? Airtable? Custom tool?]
- **Scheduling:** [TBD - Google Calendar? iCal? Manual?]

## Inspiration

- Mutual aid networks (community fridges, tool libraries)
- Skill shares (time banking without currency)
- Meetup.com (but hyperlocal, privacy-first, no corporate tracking)
- Little Free Libraries (take a skill, leave a skill)
