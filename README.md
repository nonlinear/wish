# Wish

A hyperlocal, privacy-first skill exchange and mutual aid platform.

## Overview

**Wish** connects people who want to learn with people who want to teach, and people who need help with people who can offer it. It's built around **monthly recurring meetups** where neighbors help neighbors—no money, no tracking, just community.

## Related: Wish (Micro-Volunteering)

**Note:** This project shares a name with [Wish by Praxis.nyc](https://praxis.nyc/wish/), a mutual aid micro-volunteering platform for one-off transactions (e.g., picking up compost, borrowing tools). That version facilitates individual errands with privacy-first matching.

**Key difference:**
- **Praxis Wish:** One-off transactions, many connections, ephemeral (pickup compost today, done)
- **This Wish:** Recurring communal gatherings, everyone meets same time/place (monthly skill exchange meetup)

Both privacy-first, both hyperlocal, but different models:
- Praxis = **distributed errands** (A picks up compost from B, C borrows drill from D)
- This = **communal gathering** (everyone meets 2nd Saturday 10am, helps each other)

We may merge concepts, or keep them distinct. TBD.

### How It Works

1. **People volunteer** their skills/needs
   - "I want to learn: knitting, debt refinancing, Python"
   - "I can help with: basic computer repair, Spanish tutoring, gardening"

2. **Matchmakers** (community organizers) pair people
   - Match wants with offers
   - Build monthly agenda (same time, same place)
   - Mark sessions as **open** (others can join) or **closed** (1-on-1)

3. **Helper & seeker align** before the meetup
   - "Help me to help you" checklist
   - What do you need prepared? What should I bring?
   - Clear expectations, low friction

4. **People meet, help each other, move on**
   - Monthly recurring (predictable schedule)
   - Hyperlocal (walk/bike distance)
   - Privacy-first (Signal groups, no surveillance)

### Example Agenda

**February Meetup - Saturday 10am @ Community Center**

- **10:00-11:00** - A & B: Knitting basics (open - anyone can join)
- **11:00-12:00** - C & D: Debt refinancing (closed - 1-on-1)
- **12:00-13:00** - E & F: Fix old computer (open)

## Principles

- **Privacy-first:** Signal groups, no central database, minimal data
- **Hyperlocal:** Walk/bike distance, same neighborhood
- **Recurring:** Monthly meetups, same time/place (low planning overhead)
- **Mutual aid:** No money, no hustle, just neighbors helping neighbors
- **Consent-based:** Open vs closed sessions, clear boundaries
- **Matchmaker-curated:** Human organizers, not algorithms

## Status

🌱 **Ideation** - Exploring concept, no implementation yet

## Open Questions

- **Matchmaker tooling:** What do organizers need to build agendas efficiently?
- **Signal vs other:** Is Signal the right platform, or custom chat needed?
- **Scaling:** How many people per meetup? Per matchmaker?
- **Safety:** How to handle bad actors, harassment, no-shows?
- **Onboarding:** How do new people find/join their local chapter?
- **Incentives:** What motivates matchmakers to organize (not just participate)?

---

## Tech Stack

- **Communication:** Signal (private groups)
- **Coordination:** [TBD - spreadsheet? Airtable? Custom tool?]
- **Scheduling:** [TBD - Google Calendar? iCal? Manual?]

## Inspiration

- **Mutual aid networks** (community fridges, tool libraries)
- **Skill shares** (time banking without currency)
- **Meetup.com** (but hyperlocal, privacy-first, no corporate tracking)
- **Little Free Libraries** (take a skill, leave a skill)
- **[Praxis Wish](https://praxis.nyc/wish/)** - Micro-volunteering platform for one-off transactions

### What We Learn from Praxis Wish

**Praxis Wish is transactional** (things, not crafts):
- P2P errands: pick up compost, borrow drill, get plant cutting
- Ephemeral: connection forgotten after transaction
- Privacy-first: geofenced, bottom-up taxonomy (#tags)

**But it reveals something powerful: Map of Needs**
- What do many people want? (compost, tools, rides)
- What do many people offer? (extra plants, old furniture, skills)
- What does the community actually need? (not just individuals)

**We can use this insight:**
- Matchmakers see patterns: "5 people want knitting help, 2 offer it"
- Reveals gaps: "Nobody offers debt help, but 8 people need it"
- Prioritize sessions: "Most requested = open session (anyone can join)"
- Build resilience: "If many need X, we find someone who can teach it"

**Key difference:**
- Praxis Wish = distributed transactions (things)
- This Wish = communal gathering (skills, crafts, care)
- But both reveal community needs through aggregation
